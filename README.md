# MLJAR: Your Data Science Headquarter

### Under active development

Cloud native service to utilize your data through insights and actions.

We automate machine learning usage in your organization.

## The MLJAR Roadmap

### MVP (Version 0.1)

#### The Model

- [x] Create project
- [x] Upload CSV data file
- [x] Create ML experiment for binary classification
- [x] Train xgboost
- [ ] Compute and download predictions for uploaded file

#### The Database

- [x] Connect database (postgresql)
- [x] Run query on db - store as data frame in the service
- [ ] Compute ML models on data from db

#### Usage instructions

- [ ] create docs
- [ ] create installation instructions
- [ ] run on AWS / DO ?
- [ ] contribution

---

#### Version 0.2 (Database automation)

- [ ] Apply ML models on new db rows, insert predictions into database
- [ ] Schedule db checks every time period (1, 5, 10 minutes)

### Version 0.3 (Charting)

- [ ] Charts (bar, line)
- [ ] Dashboards

### Version 0.4 (Understand ML)

- [ ] Add random model - check how good my models are
- [ ] Add decision trees algorithm with model visualization
- [ ] Feature importance

### Version 0.5 (Email in the service)

- [ ] Email alerts
- [ ] Email as flow trigger
- [ ] Email as flow result

### Version 0.6 (Pretrained models)

- [ ] Use pretrained models (mainly for NLP tasks, like sentiment computation, automatic tagging)

### Version 1.0

- [ ] Ability to train classification (binary, multi class) and regression models
- [ ] Accept input data from flat files and databases
- [ ] Be able to define automatic work flows powered with Machine Learning

### Next versions

- [ ] Outliers detection
- [ ] Working with time series data
- [ ] Reading data from external services -> be like zapier but for machine learning
